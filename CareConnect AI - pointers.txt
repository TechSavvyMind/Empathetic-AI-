📌 Problem Statement: HUMANIZING DIGITAL CONVERSATIONS

Current customer service chatbots lack empathy, struggle with unscripted or complex queries, and lose accuracy during long conversations, often resulting in hallucinations.
Additionally, advanced reasoning models introduce latency, reducing the quality of real-time customer support.

⚠️ Industrial Challenges
1. Human-Like Interaction Gaps

Inability to detect emotional cues or respond empathetically.

Leads to reduced customer trust and dissatisfaction.

2. Limited Handling of Complex Queries

Effective only for SOP-based tasks; fail on non-scripted, real-world issues.

Resulting in increased escalations and higher support costs.

3. Model Constraints & Latency

Context overflow in long conversations → hallucinated or irrelevant replies.

High-latency reasoning models degrade real-time user experience.

🎯 Scope & Dataset
Domain: Telecom Industry

Focus on enhancing customer support for mobile and broadband services, where timely, empathetic, and accurate assistance is critical.

Dataset: Mobile & Broadband Customer Queries

Chosen because:

Telecom users frequently report emotion-driven issues (network outage, billing confusion, connectivity problems).

High volume of unscripted and complex queries ideal for evaluating empathy, context handling, and reasoning.

Enables realistic testing of hallucination reduction and latency improvements in long, multi-turn conversations.
