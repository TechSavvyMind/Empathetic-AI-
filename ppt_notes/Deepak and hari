1️⃣ Architecture Overview – Orchestrated Dual Agent System

(Presenter 1)

Key Points to Say:

“Our architecture solves the biggest challenge in support automation: combining speed, empathy, and deep reasoning in one system.”

“We use an Orchestrator that performs deep intent + emotion analysis and decides which path to send the query to — Fast or ReAct.”

“The Fast Agent handles known SOP flows instantly using ChromaDB + SQL, giving sub-300ms responses.”

“The ReAct Agent handles complex telecom issues using multi-step reasoning and tool calls.”

“An empathetic response layer rewrites outputs in the right tone.”

“Finally, everything is logged for audit, safety, and continuous improvement.”

Goal of this slide:
Show how smart routing + dual agents create a human-like, accurate support experience.

2️⃣ Fast Agent – SOP/DB Path

(Presenter 2)

Key Points to Say:

“This agent handles predictable, repeated telecom issues like: plan checks, router resets, billing summaries, recharge info.”

“It retrieves SOPs instantly using vector search + SQL lookups.”

“This is our speed engine — responses are consistent, accurate, and extremely fast.”

“It also triggers intelligent ticket creation for known error patterns.”

Goal of this slide:
Show this agent ensures speed, accuracy, and operational efficiency.

3️⃣ ReAct Agent – Deep Reasoning Path

(Presenter 3)

Key Points to Say:

“This agent handles unscripted or complex cases—like disputes, network escalations, multi-step troubleshooting.”

“It uses a Thought → Action → Observation loop, similar to a human expert.”

“It can call tools like database queries, outage checkers, or escalation logic.”

“When needed, it escalates to human agents with a context summary.”

Goal of this slide:
Show this agent covers scenarios where SOP-only systems usually fail.

4️⃣ Empathetic Response Synthesizer

(Presenter 4)

Key Points to Say:

“Every response is rewritten with sentiment-aware tone—calming frustrated users, guiding confused users.”

“It also explains actions clearly, like ticket creation or next steps.”

“This layer ensures the bot doesn’t sound robotic.”

Goal of this slide:
Show how the bot builds trust with natural, human-like communication.
