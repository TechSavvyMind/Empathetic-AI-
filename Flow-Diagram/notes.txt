UI (Chatbot)
The process starts when the user interacts with the UI chatbot.
Orchestrator
The chatbot sends the user’s query to the Orchestrator, which decides how to handle it.
Two Paths
Fast LLM: A quick AI model that checks:
SOP + DB (Standard Operating Procedures and Database)
DB (Database)
Canonical (Official reference)
Goal: Give a fast response.
Ref LLM: A more detailed AI model that uses DB and other references for accuracy.
Response Decision
If the confidence score is greater than 5, the system sends the response back to the user.
If confidence is low, it goes to a Human Agent for manual help.
Memory & Cache
Responses and data are stored in Memory and Cache so future queries can be answered faster.
